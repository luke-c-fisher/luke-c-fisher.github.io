I am a Econ and Analytics grad from Michigan State University. My interests lie in Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis in solving problems in Healthcare. Specificially, I am interested in Algorithms and their role in predicting health outcomes.

My story begins at a small summer camp in New Hampshire. Here, I came across the simple but valuable phrase, "be a pro". It didn't mean anything to me at first—it seemed like a way for my boss to say, "figure it out"—but as camp progressed, It started to make sense; I would think, "be a pro", "be a pro", as I jumped into a kyak to prevent immenant disaster. This mantra would repeat itself in my head each time I faced an unfamiliar task; yet, each time I managed to come out unscathed—better than than I was before. It occured to me here that the phrase, "be a pro", was not merely a suggestion, but an identity. Acting *as if* I was a "pro" made me competent at my job, even if my experience said otherwise. 

Marcus Aurelius once remarked, "Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts", and if your thoughts are colored with a disbelief in yourself, your identity will follow. 

 
My work
======

My work is on predictive modeling for disease detection. Specifically, I developed two classifiers using logistic regression and gradient boost to predict diabetes. My goal was to determine the better classifier by comparing their  metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC. In this context, the best classifier was selected based on accuracy and sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate. This project taught me the importance of error reduction and model selection in classification.
