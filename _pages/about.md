I am a senior at Michigan State University, working towards my Economics degree with a specialization in Data Analytics. My interests are in Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis in solving problems in healthcare. Specificially, I am interested in Machine Learning and its role in predicting health outcomes.

Selected Experience
======

My experience has ranged from corporate intern, to Barcelona tour guide, to camp counselor. Each of these roles has provided me with invaluable skills. As a camp counselor, I picked up on the maxim, "be a pro", which has since motivated me to pursue new experiences, such as leading tours in a foreign country and building a data project from scratch.   

My work
======

My work is on predictive modeling for disease detection. Specifically, I developed two classifiers using logistic regression and gradient boosting to predict diabetes. My goal was to determine the better classifier by comparing their classification metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC. In the context of disease detection, the "better" model was defined as the one with the highest accuracy and sensitivityâ€”or true positive rate. This latter metric was crucial as it measured the extent of correctly identified true cases of diabetes.
