I am a senior at Michigan State University, working towards my Economics degree with a specialization in Data Analytics. My interests are in Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis in solving problems in healthcare. Specificially, I am interested in Machine Learning and its role in predicting health outcomes.
 
My work
======

My work is on predictive modeling for disease detection. Specifically, I developed two classifiers using logistic regression and gradient boost to predict diabetes. My goal was to determine the better classifier by comparing their  metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC. In this context, the best classifier was selected based on accuracy and sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate. This project taught me the importance of error reduction and model selection in classification.
